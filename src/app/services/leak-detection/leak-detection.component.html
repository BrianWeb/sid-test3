        <h2>Leak Detection Dublin</h2>

        <p>If you think you may have a hidden burst pipe or small leak in your home. Then see if some of the following questions apply to your dwelling.</p>

        <p>Do you feel that your water use is too high?</p>

        <p>Do you have unexplained brown staining on Ceilings or walls in your home?</p>

        <p>Perhaps there is walls or floors are inexplicably damp or wet?</p>

        <p>Are you finding drips occasionally and are at a loss as to where they are coming from ?</p>

        <p>It is likely that you might have a leaking pipe but not to worry we can help you to fix this.</p>

        <p>For many of our past customers thought they were going mad as they would be finding drips in there house that would not always be there when they came back to check later. One customer when she contacted us thought that it may be just condensation from the kettle collection on her ceiling but we knew that would not create such a stain and it was a leaking pipe above the plaster board.</p>
